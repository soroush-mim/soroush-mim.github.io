I recently graduated from [Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)](https://aut.ac.ir/en) with a **MSc in AI**, where I successfully defended my thesis on **improving the robustness of deep neural networks against adversarial attacks** under the guidance of [Prof. AmirMazlaghani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gxbTUfEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Alongside my studies, I was actively engaged as a research assistant in the Statistical Data Analysis Laboratory where I studied the adversarial robustness of deep learning models.

Now, I'm excited to explore the world of computational neuroscience. I want to combine my machine learning and deep learning knowledge with studying the brain's visual system. Additionally, **I am strongly interested in Generative AI, understanding the inner workings of deep learning models, and computer vision.** These areas are my passion, and I'm eager to **pursue a Ph.D. to further explore and contribute to these fields.** By bringing together computational models and neuroscience, I hope to contribute to understanding the brain and advancing AI.
