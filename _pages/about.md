Hello! Iâ€™m a curious human being who is deeply passionate about **unraveling the mysteries of the human brain, particularly the intricacies of the visual system.** I aim to leverage this knowledge to develop advanced AI vision models, which led me to pursue a Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence.

I recently graduated from [Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)](https://aut.ac.ir/en) with a **MSc in AI**, where I successfully defended my thesis on **improving the robustness of deep neural networks against adversarial attacks** under the guidance of [Prof. AmirMazlaghani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gxbTUfEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Alongside my studies, I was actively engaged as a research assistant in the Statistical Data Analysis Laboratory where I studied the adversarial robustness of deep learning models.

Now, my enthusiasm drives me towards the fascinating world of computational neuroscience. I aim to merge my expertise in machine learning and deep learning with the complexities of the brain's visual system. Additionally, **I have a strong interest in computational vision, understanding the inner workings of deep learning models, and computer vision.** These areas are my passion, and I'm eager to **pursue a Ph.D. to further explore and contribute to these fields.** By uniting computational models with neuroscientific insights, I'm committed to advancing this dynamic field and uncovering the mysteries at the intersection of neuroscience and AI.
