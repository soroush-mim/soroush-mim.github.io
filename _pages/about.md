Hello! Iâ€™m a curious human being who is deeply passionate about **unraveling the mysteries of the human brain, particularly the intricacies of the visual system.** I aim to leverage this knowledge to develop advanced AI vision models, which led me to pursue a Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence.

I recently graduated from [**Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)**](https://aut.ac.ir/en) with a **MSc in AI**, where I successfully defended my thesis on **improving the robustness of deep neural networks against adversarial attacks** under the guidance of [Prof. AmirMazlaghani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gxbTUfEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Alongside my studies, I was actively engaged as a research assistant in the Statistical Data Analysis Laboratory where I studied the adversarial robustness of deep learning models.

Now, I am eager to embark on computational neuroscience research, leveraging my expertise in machine learning and deep learning to shed light on the complexities of the brain's visual system. By combining computational models with neuroscientific insights, **I strive to contribute to this dynamic field and unravel the mysteries at the intersection of neuroscience and AI. I actively seek out Ph.D. positions to continue my academic journey**, motivated by the potential to significantly advance our understanding of biological vision and cognition through this interdisciplinary approach. My research will lead to technological and scientific breakthroughs, as well as applications like improved AI systems and human-computer interfaces that benefit society.
