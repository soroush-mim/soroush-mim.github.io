I recently graduated from [Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)](https://aut.ac.ir/en) with an **MSc in AI**, where I successfully defended my thesis on **improving the robustness of deep neural networks against adversarial attacks**, under the guidance of [Prof. Amir Mazlaghani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gxbTUfEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). During this time, I also served as a research assistant in the Statistical Data Analysis Laboratory, focusing on adversarial robustness in deep learning.

I am currently a research assistant in the **Autonomous & Intelligent Systems Lab (AISL)** at Amirkabir University of Technology, where I work on **3D computer vision**, with a particular emphasis on **structure-from-motion (SfM)** techniques powered by deep learning.

My research interests include:
- **3D Computer Vision**
- **Computer Vision**
- **Computational Neuroscience**
- **Understanding the inner workings of Deep Learning models**
- **Generative AI**

I'm passionate about exploring the intersection between **3D vision**, **brain-inspired modeling**, and **generative techniques**, and I aim to pursue a Ph.D. to further contribute to these areas.

**If you’d like to collaborate on Deep Learning projects, explore computational neuroscience, or discuss Ph.D. opportunities, please feel free to reach out—I'd love to connect!**
